We engaged overpriced consultants for thousands of dollars but most of the leg work was asked to be done by us. We scoured the internet for a simple step by step process to understand the process but we ended up reading mighty long pages without any natural flow and eventually ended up confused. So we came up with the idea to help our users navigate through the hurdles of the immigration process through a self serve mobile app which would guide the users through a step by step process.
